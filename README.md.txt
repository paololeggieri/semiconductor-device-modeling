# Semiconductor Device Modeling (MATLAB)

This repository contains simple MATLAB scripts for modeling semiconductor device behavior.

## Step 1: Ideal Diode I–V (Shockley equation)
- Script: `code/diode_IV_ideal.m`
- Outputs: I–V curve (linear scale) and semilog plot

## Next steps
- Temperature sweep
- Add series resistance model
